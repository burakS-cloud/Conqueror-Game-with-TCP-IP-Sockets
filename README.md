# Conqueror-Game-with-TCP-IP-Sockets
This project was for my final exam of the class i was taking called "Computer Network Programming".
The game rules are:
Each player starts with a 5 randomly placed flags that they see on their map. 15x17 pixels buttons are representing those flags which there are 28 of them on the map for each player to see.
Each player is trying to find/click on the buttons that are representing their opponent's flags. When you conquer 5 of your opponent's flags, you win the game.

Notes before running the programs:

WindowsForms3App = server
WindowsForms5App = client

Blue bottons: Indicates the places you've conquered.
Yellow buttons: Indicates the places you've lost and your opponent conquered from you.
Red buttons: Indicates both player's past moves, failed moves (couldn't find a flag).
Green buttons: Indicates your flags.

To run the game, for server, you should go to WindowsFormsApp3/WindowsFormsApp3/bin/Debug and run the WindowsFormsApp3.exe
For client, go to WindowsFormsApp5/WindowsFormsApp5/bin/Debug and run the WindowsFormsApp5.exe

# Enjoy the game written in C#, utilizing TCP/IP Socket Programming principles :)
